        "description": "XSwap is proud to be one of the first platforms leveraging Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This pioneering step sets XSwap apart from other DeFi platforms and is positioned to become a leader in the field of cross-chain swaps. \nXSwap has confirmed to launch their own token in the future and has launched a points system. Users who make swaps on the platform earn points earn points based on swap count and swap volume. Also, earn 15% of the points from each referral. Users who collect points would likely get an airdrop when their token goes live.",
